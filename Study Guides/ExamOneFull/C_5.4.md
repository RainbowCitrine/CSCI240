### C_5.4

---

Suppose Alice has picked three distinct integers and placed them into a
stack S in random order. Write a short, straight-line piece of pseudo-code
(with no loops or recursion) that uses only one comparison and only one
variable x, yet guarantees with probability 2/3 that at the end of this code
the variable x will store the largest of Aliceâ€™s three integers. Argue why
your method is correct.

To be able to do this in one line of code or statement would be impossible because you are forced to compare two conditions, however we can try to do this with syntax rules 

x = S.pop(), y = S.pop(), z = S.pop(); 

if(y > x) x = y; if(z > x) z = x; 

This is guranteed 2/3 because you have 3 possible orders this will result in storing the correct largest element.
