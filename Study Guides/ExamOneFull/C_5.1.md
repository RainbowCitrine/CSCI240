### C-5.1

---

Explain how you can implement all the functions of the deque ADT using
two stacks.

---

1. Create two stacks you will need one for rear and front 

2. Create two functions one for insert front and rear. Use the front and rear stacks to push elements into the dequeue 

3. To remove from the rear you have to grab the top of the rear stack and pop the item 

4. To remove from the front you have to grab the top of the front stack and pop the item 

5. To get front simply return the top of the front stack 

6. To get the rear simply return the top of the rear stack

7. to check for empty you can just use the stl empty function to check both stacks 

The time complexity is O(1), however a doubly linked list can also achieve O(1)
