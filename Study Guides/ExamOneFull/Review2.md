### What principle(s) can be used to achieve the design goal of adaptability 

---

- Abstraction: Can make it easier to move sensitive information without affecting the rest of the system.

- Encapsulation: The reason is because you can use it to keep all operations in one class to be able to move the code to the place where it needs to be adapted too. 

- Modularity: This helps seperate functions in different modules making it easier to navigate through the design and should make for an easier transition.
