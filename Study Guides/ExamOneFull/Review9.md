### What are two possible prototypes for the pop() operation? Which one is better? 

--- 

The two prototypes would either be a return function or viod function. I would recommend to use a return function because with the return function you can still keep the data in case if you would like to use it for somewhere else in your program. Whereas if you used a void you lost that data completely and wont have access to it.
