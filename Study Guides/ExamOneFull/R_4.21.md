### R-4.21

Bill has an algorithm, find2D, to find an element x in an n Ã— n array A.
The algorithm find2D iterates over the rows of A, and calls the algorithm
arrayFind, of Code Fragment 4.5, on each row, until x is found or it has
searched all rows of A. What is the worst-case running time of find2D in
terms of n? What is the worst-case running time of find2D in terms of N,
where N is the total size of A? Would it be correct to say that Find2D is a
linear-time algorithm? Why or why not?

- If bill decides to utilize a 2D array and traverses to all rows and all columns he would have to traverse of i < row and j < columns deeming these numbers unknown making this algorithms worst case O(n^2). The proof we can use is the following: n(n+1) making it this case a quadratic algorithm and not linear because the math shows we would get a polynomial of n^2 greatest term. In terms of Bill calling his function that would still be O(n^2) because the find is still traversing a certain amount of numbers in the up row and we still are not aware of what the numbers could be. Still making the math n(n + 1), usually we do not count function calling in algorithm analysis unless it shows recursion. However, this question grants that exception. If we didn't have said exception the algorithm function calling would just be a simple + 1 and this part of the algorithm would just be O(n) ONLY IF HE IS LOOPING THROUGH THE ROWS and nothing else.
