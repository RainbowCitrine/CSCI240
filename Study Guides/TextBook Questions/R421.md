### Bill has an algorithm, find2D, to find an element x in an n Ã— n array A.
The algorithm find2D iterates over the rows of A, and calls the algorithm
arrayFind, of Code Fragment 4.5, on each row, until x is found or it has
searched all rows of A. What is the worst-case running time of find2D in
terms of n? What is the worst-case running time of find2D in terms of N,
where N is the total size of A? Would it be correct to say that Find2D is a
linear-time algorithm? Why or why not?

- Reading just the rows would just be (n + 1) 

- ArrayFind(n) to go through each row until x is found or it has searched all rows of A. n * n O(n^2).

- No because this is a quadratic algorithm
